# FakeNews

This was my first attempt with NLP and working on a team to clean and model text data. This is part of the Kaggle competition https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news.
Unfortuntley, I was not able to provide the cleaned dataset that I use in ModelFitting.R as it exceeds githubs 100mb file limit.
Due to the size and nature of the data, one of the fun parts of this project was being able to use BYU's servers within the Stats department to run our models. So, I learned how to utlize Window's Linux subsystem and copy and run files on a remote server!
